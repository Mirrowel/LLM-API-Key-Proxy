Title: Comprehensive review of PR #6 (LLM-API-Key-Proxy)

Summary
- Overall: The PR substantially extends provider support (notably Gemini CLI and Qwen Code OAuth), improves resilience (cooldowns, retries, usage tracking), and enhances diagnostics (detailed per-request logging, failure logs). The architecture aligns well with the existing separation between src/proxy_app and src/rotator_library, leveraging RotatingClient as the retry/cooldown layer and plugin-based provider adapters.
- Readiness: With a few targeted fixes (committed in this review) and some follow-ups outlined below, the PR looks good. Core endpoints behave as expected, with OpenAI-compatible shapes and streaming aggregation. Security and reliability are largely solid after redacting secrets from logs and fixing minor OAuth handling issues.

Key changes merged in this review
1) rotator_library/client.py
- Fixed oauth bootstrap and source-of-truth handling:
  - Accept OAuth-only configurations and do not require API keys if OAuth credentials are present.
  - Stop re-discovering OAuth credentials in RotatingClient; use the prepared credentials passed in from main.py.
- Effect: Eliminates a logical regression where previously discovered OAuth credentials would be discarded and allows OAuth-only deployments.

2) rotator_library/background_refresher.py
- Fixed provider plugin lookup during proactive refresh to use the actual provider key (e.g., 'gemini_cli'), not a non-existent '{provider}_oauth'.
- Effect: Ensures proactive token refresh runs for configured OAuth providers.

3) proxy_app/detailed_logger.py and rotator_library/failure_logger.py
- Redact sensitive request headers and body fields in logs (Authorization, X-API-Key, API-Key, Cookies, and body.api_key) and mask bearer tokens.
- Effect: Prevents accidental leakage of secrets in logs while preserving useful diagnostics.

Major findings and recommendations
1) OAuth discovery and lifecycle
- Issue: RotatingClient previously constructed a CredentialManager with the already-prepared oauth_credentials mapping and called discover_and_prepare() again, which expects env-like inputs. This silently dropped credentials and blocked OAuth-only runs.
- Fix: Applied. RotatingClient now treats the provided oauth_credentials as final and only builds the unified credential pool. Main performs the (optional) OAuth initialization and deduplication.

2) Background refresher
- Issue: Used _get_provider_instance(f"{provider}_oauth") which never matches any provider module, disabling proactive refresh.
- Fix: Applied. Uses provider directly.

3) Logging secrets
- Issue: Detailed per-request logs included full inbound request headers (containing the proxy Authorization bearer) and possibly body.api_key. Failure logs also recorded raw request headers.
- Fix: Applied: redact typical sensitive headers and any idempotent api_key body field. Mask bearer tokens while leaving the header present to retain signal.
- Suggestion: Consider adding an env flag to disable body logging entirely or log only a structural summary for high-security deployments.

4) Streaming aggregator and usage accounting
- The custom streaming aggregation in RotatingClient._safe_streaming_wrapper and main.streaming_response_wrapper appears consistent with OpenAI SSE chunks. It avoids yielding DONE after disconnects and always releases keys. It correctly records usage from chunks when present.
- Suggestion: For extreme traffic, consider an option to disable chunk re-assembly for logging to reduce memory, but current implementation is reasonable.

5) Error classification and cooldowns
- classify_error covers litellm and httpx variants and attempts to extract retry-after. CooldownManager uses provider-global cooldowns to mitigate IP-based rate limit storms, and UsageManager enforces escalating per-key per-model cooldowns. This is a good balance of resilience and fairness across keys.
- Suggestion: Consider recording the provider-global cooldown start/expiry in the debug log (already logged) and optionally export a readiness/health endpoint that reports cooldowns for observability.

6) Provider adapters
- Gemini CLI provider implements fully custom streaming via the Code Assist endpoint and returns OpenAI-shaped chunks. Tool choice translation and schema normalization look correct. Qwen OAuth base is similarly robust (device code flow and refresh flow). Safety setting transforms for standard providers are plumbed through.
- Suggestion: Add unit-smoke tests for tool_choice translation and schema transform to prevent regressions.

7) Environment and configuration
- .env.example: Clear guidance for one-time OAuth import and local-first strategy under oauth_creds/. The SKIP_OAUTH_INIT_CHECK is helpful for non-interactive environments.
- Suggestion: Consider adding a PROXY_LOG_LEVEL env var to quickly adjust console verbosity without code changes.

Endpoint validation (manual)
- Startup: PROXY_API_KEY required; server refuses to start otherwise. OAuth init can be skipped via SKIP_OAUTH_INIT_CHECK=true. API-keys discovery uses <PROVIDER>_API_KEY_* env vars.
- GET /: returns status JSON.
- GET /v1/providers: enumerates discovered providers from PROVIDER_PLUGINS.
- POST /v1/chat/completions: accepts standard OpenAI shape; supports streaming and non-streaming; logs final reconstructed response via DetailedLogger.
- POST /v1/embeddings: supports optional server-side batching (disabled by default) and direct pass-through otherwise.
- GET /v1/models: Flattens model list across providers, filters by env-driven ignore/whitelist.
- POST /v1/token-count: counts tokens using litellm token_counter.

Async correctness and concurrency
- Key pool: UsageManager tracks per-model locks with asyncio conditions; acquire_key respects a global deadline and per-key/model cooldowns; release_key notifies waiters.
- Retries: Both non-streaming and streaming have per-key retry loops with exponential/backoff bounded by global deadline and provider-level cooldowns.
- Client disconnects: Streaming wrapper checks request.is_disconnected() and halts producing DONE; finalizer always releases locks.

Security review
- Proxy API key: enforced via Authorization header check. Now redacted in logs.
- Provider secrets: Drawn from env, never logged; any accidental body.api_key now redacted. Failure logs do not dump outbound auth headers.
- SSRF/path: Provider URLs in request_logger are inferred only for logging and never used to route outbound traffic; no SSRF risk.
- Input validation: Main raises 4xx for invalid/stateless errors via litellm.

Reliability and performance
- Timeouts/backoffs: Global timeout budget in RotatingClient bounds retries; per-attempt backoffs respect remaining budget; provider-level cooldowns reduce error storms.
- Logging: LiteLLM logs routed to a file-only debug handler via _litellm_logger_callback, with sanitized payloads.

Lint/format/typecheck
- The code follows existing style patterns. Minimal imports were removed to avoid unused warnings.

Suggested follow-ups (not blocking)
- Tests: Add basic tests for
  - OAuth-only startup flow
  - background_refresher proactive refresh call path
  - detailed_logger redaction behavior
  - provider tools translation (Gemini CLI)
- Observability: Optional health/readiness endpoint including provider cooldowns.
- Config: Env var to disable request body logging entirely in DetailedLogger.

Inline review comments to post on GitHub
1) src/rotator_library/client.py (init):
- Before: Re-discovered OAuth credentials via CredentialManager, discarding prepared inputs and preventing OAuth-only usage.
- After: Accept provided oauth_credentials and allow OAuth-only configs; build unified credentials once.

2) src/rotator_library/background_refresher.py (provider lookup):
- Replace _get_provider_instance(f"{provider}_oauth") with _get_provider_instance(provider). No provider plugin named '*_oauth' exists.

3) src/proxy_app/detailed_logger.py (secrets in logs):
- Redact Authorization, X-API-Key, API-Key, Cookies, and body.api_key. Mask bearer tokens as 'Bearer <REDACTED>'.

4) src/rotator_library/failure_logger.py (secrets in logs):
- Redact inbound request headers similarly to prevent proxy key leakage in failure logs.

How to reproduce and validate locally
- cp .env.example .env, set PROXY_API_KEY and at least one API key variable like OPENAI_API_KEY_1 to boot; set SKIP_OAUTH_INIT_CHECK=true for non-interactive runs.
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- python -m uvicorn proxy_app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
- curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $PROXY_API_KEY" http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/providers
- Exercise chat, embeddings, models, and token-count endpoints. Check logs/ for redactions.
